This example demonstrates a common TypeScript error that occurs when passing an array to a function that expects a string. The error message is "Type 'string[]' is not assignable to type 'string'". This happens because the function `greeter` is defined to accept a single string argument, but an array of strings is passed to it. The solution involves modifying the function to accept an array of strings or iterating over the array and calling the function multiple times.
